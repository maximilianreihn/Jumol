Molecular mechanics library: JuMol

This library can be used to do furthter develop numerical approaches in molecular mechanics with particular emphasis on the mechanics of disordered solids.

**To run all tests and set up the proper environment run setup.jl**

Before studying into the code it is recommended to study the following paper:
